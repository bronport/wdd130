        <p><strong>Purpose of Athlete Compare</strong><br>
          Athlete Compare exists to help sports fans make fair, informed comparisons between professional athletes without relying on bias or heated opinions. Sports debates are common among fans, but they often rely on selective stats or personal loyalty rather than full context. This site was created to provide a clean, simple, and visually clear way to compare athletes using meaningful data. By placing two players side-by-side, users can quickly understand strengths, weaknesses, and overall impact without digging through multiple websites.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Why Fans Will Visit This Site</strong><br>
          Visitors will come to Athlete Compare when they want quick answers to common sports questions such as “Who had the better career?” or “Which player is more efficient?” Many existing sports sites overwhelm users with ads, cluttered tables, or advanced analytics that are difficult to understand. Athlete Compare focuses on clarity and usability, making it appealing to casual fans, students, and younger audiences who want reliable comparisons without complexity.
        </p>

        <p><strong>How the Site Works</strong><br>
          The home page introduces users to how Athlete Compare functions in a simple three-step process. First, users select a sport. Next, they choose two athletes they want to compare. Finally, they view a visual head-to-head comparison that highlights key statistics, awards, and career context. This straightforward process ensures users can get value from the site immediately without needing prior statistical knowledge.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Value Compared to Other Sports Sites</strong><br>
          What sets Athlete Compare apart is its focus on fairness and presentation. Instead of overwhelming users with every available statistic, the site highlights the most meaningful metrics and explains why they matter. Visual elements such as icons, charts, and clean layouts help users understand differences at a glance. This makes Athlete Compare a useful educational tool as well as a fun resource for sports fans.

        <h3>Compare (compare.html)</h3>

        <p><strong>Interactive Comparison Experience</strong><br>
          The Compare page is the core of the Athlete Compare website. This page allows users to actively select two athletes and see their careers compared side-by-side. The design prioritizes ease of use, with simple form inputs and clear labels that guide the user through the comparison process. Even users unfamiliar with advanced sports statistics will feel comfortable navigating the page.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Key Statistics and Metrics</strong><br>
          Once athletes are selected, users are shown per-game statistics, efficiency metrics, and career totals relevant to the chosen sport. For example, basketball comparisons may include points per game, shooting efficiency, and advanced metrics such as player efficiency rating. These numbers are displayed in a consistent format so users can easily see where one athlete outperforms another.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Awards and Career Context</strong><br>
          Statistics alone do not tell the full story of an athlete’s career, so the Compare page also includes awards and achievements. Championships, MVP awards, All-Star selections, and years played help provide context and balance raw numbers. This ensures comparisons are fair and consider longevity, consistency, and impact rather than isolated performance.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Accessibility and Visual Design</strong><br>
          The Compare page is designed with accessibility in mind. High-contrast colors, readable fonts, and labeled tables ensure the content is usable for all visitors, including those using screen readers. Visual charts and icons help communicate information quickly while maintaining a clean and professional appearance.

        <h3>About / Methodology (about.html)</h3>

        <p><strong>How Comparisons Are Calculated</strong><br>
          The About page explains how Athlete Compare selects and presents data. Metrics are chosen based on relevance and clarity rather than volume. The goal is not to overwhelm users but to highlight statistics that most accurately reflect performance. Definitions are provided so users understand what each metric means and why it is included.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Ethical Use of Data and Images</strong><br>
          Athlete Compare avoids using copyrighted team logos or restricted images. Instead, the site relies on royalty-free images, silhouettes, icons, and self-created graphics. This approach ensures the site remains educational and compliant with copyright guidelines while still providing a visually engaging experience.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Limitations and Fair Interpretation</strong><br>
          No comparison tool is perfect, and this page openly discusses limitations. Differences in eras, rule changes, team roles, and sample sizes can affect statistics. Users are encouraged to view comparisons as informative tools rather than absolute judgments. This transparency helps build trust with visitors.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Educational and Future Goals</strong><br>
          Beyond settling debates, Athlete Compare aims to teach users how to think critically about sports statistics. In the future, the site may expand to include more sports, deeper filtering options, and improved visualizations. The long-term goal is to make sports analytics approachable for everyone.
