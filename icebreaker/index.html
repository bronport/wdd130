    <h2>Porter Bronson</h2>
    <p>Hey I am Porter Bronson! I am married and have a dog named Bonnie, she is a yorkie. It will be my wife and I's two year anniversary on Tuesday! I am trying to work full time while doing school at the same time. I currently work at Wells Fargo as a Relationship Banker. I am very grateful for my job and all it has taught me. One of my favorite things to do is play basketball with friends and family. I have played basketball my whole life. I am very excited to learn in this class with all of you!</p>
